Wine quality prediction is a machine learning task that aims to predict the quality of wines based on certain input features. This task is typically approached as a regression problem, where the goal is to predict a continuous value (quality score) based on the characteristics of the wine.

The dataset used for wine quality prediction usually consists of various attributes or features that describe each wine sample, such as:

Fixed acidity: The non-volatile acids present in the wine.
Volatile acidity: The amount of volatile acids in the wine, which contributes to its aroma.
Citric acid: The amount of citric acid in the wine, which affects its freshness and tartness.
Residual sugar: The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation.
Chlorides: The amount of salt in the wine, which impacts its taste.
Free sulfur dioxide: The free form of sulfur dioxide, which acts as an antioxidant and preservative.
Total sulfur dioxide: The sum of both free and bound forms of sulfur dioxide.
Density: The density of the wine.
pH: The acidity level of the wine, which affects its stability and taste.
Sulphates: The amount of sulfur dioxide bound to other chemicals in the wine.
Alcohol: The alcohol content of the wine.
